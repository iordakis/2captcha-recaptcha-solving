Sometimes you may need to automatically bypass a captcha.
Luckily this can be done using a 3rd-party services like 2captcha.
This code holds a manufactured HTTP transaction using the 2captcha API calls.

1. We send a captcha ID and within a few seconds we should receive the solution as a string.
2. Further, you can use that string in your next POST request to the website to bypass the verification.
